Here are detailed guidelines for implementing a data tagging framework that categorizes information based on sensitivity and access levels, helping to streamline data handling, access, and protection across [Bank's Name].

---

# Data Tagging Guidelines

Purpose: To provide a clear, standardized framework for classifying and tagging data based on sensitivity and access requirements. These guidelines will ensure that employees and systems manage data according to security policies, regulatory requirements, and internal operational needs.

### Data Classification Levels and Tagging

The data tagging framework categorizes data into four main levels: Public, Internal, Confidential, and Restricted. Each level has specific handling requirements, security measures, and access controls to safeguard information according to its risk level.

| Classification | Definition | Examples | Tagging Label | Access Level | Handling Requirements |
|----------------|------------|----------|---------------|--------------|-----------------------|
| Public     | Data that can be freely shared with the public without any risk to the institution. | Marketing materials, publicly released reports, press releases | `Public` | Open to all employees and third parties | No specific handling requirements |
| Internal   | Data intended for internal use and accessible to all employees but not for public release. | Internal policy documents, internal reports without sensitive data | `Internal` | Accessible to all employees | Limit sharing outside the organization; basic access controls |
| Confidential | Sensitive data with moderate risk that could impact the organization if disclosed. | Customer PII, employee records, financial statements | `Confidential` | Limited to specific roles and departments; authorized personnel only | Encryption in storage and transit; restricted access; audit logs |
| Restricted | Highly sensitive data that could cause significant financial, legal, or reputational damage if disclosed. | Credit card data, proprietary algorithms, legal documents, executive reports | `Restricted` | Only accessible by authorized individuals with strict need-to-know basis | Multi-factor authentication, strict access controls, DLP monitoring |

### Detailed Guidelines by Classification Level

#### 1. Public Data  
   - Tag: `Public`
   - Definition: Information that poses no risk if shared outside the organization.
   - Examples: Press releases, promotional materials, public reports, website content.
   - Access and Handling:
      - Accessible to all employees, partners, and the public.
      - No specific security measures are required, but ensure data accuracy and consistency.

#### 2. Internal Data  
   - Tag: `Internal`
   - Definition: Information intended solely for internal use but that poses low risk if exposed externally.
   - Examples: Internal procedural documents, internal business strategy plans.
   - Access and Handling:
      - Accessible to all employees.
      - Should not be shared outside the organization without manager approval.
      - Use secure internal systems (e.g., intranet) for storage and sharing.

#### 3. Confidential Data  
   - Tag: `Confidential`
   - Definition: Sensitive information that could cause harm to the organization or individuals if disclosed.
   - Examples: Customer PII, internal financial reports, employee payroll data, proprietary technology.
   - Access and Handling:
      - Accessible only to authorized roles or departments, with approval from department heads.
      - Must be encrypted both in storage and during transmission.
      - Only share on a need-to-know basis within the organization; approval required for external sharing.
      - Maintain audit trails to track data access and modifications.
      - Regularly review permissions to ensure adherence to the least privilege principle.

#### 4. Restricted Data  
   - Tag: `Restricted`
   - Definition: Highly sensitive information that could cause significant harm, legal repercussions, or financial loss if disclosed.
   - Examples: Payment card information, executive meeting minutes, legal documents, strategic business plans.
   - Access and Handling:
      - Accessible only by select, authorized personnel with a strict need-to-know basis.
      - Enforced multi-factor authentication (MFA) for system access.
      - Full encryption at rest and during transmission, with advanced security protocols.
      - Regular monitoring through Data Loss Prevention (DLP) tools to detect unauthorized sharing or access attempts.
      - Log and review all access to ensure compliance and prevent unauthorized actions.
      - External sharing of restricted data is prohibited without executive-level approval, and only under secure, verifiable conditions (e.g., encrypted file transfer).

---

### Data Tagging Implementation Process

1. Identify Data: Work with department heads and data owners to categorize existing data based on its sensitivity and risk.
2. Apply Tags: Apply the appropriate tags (Public, Internal, Confidential, Restricted) to files, documents, and databases. This can be done manually or through automated tools if available.
3. Review and Update: Regularly review data classifications to ensure they remain accurate, particularly as data may evolve in sensitivity.
4. Automated Enforcement: Where possible, implement automated tagging and enforcement policies within data management and security systems to ensure consistency.

### Special Considerations

- Third-Party Data: When dealing with third-party or vendor data, assess the sensitivity based on contractual obligations and legal requirements. Apply tagging according to the closest matching internal category.
- Data Aggregation: Sometimes, combining datasets increases sensitivity (e.g., aggregated reports on customer behavior). Tag aggregated data based on the highest level of sensitivity within the dataset.
- Temporary Reclassification: For certain projects or reports, data may be temporarily reclassified (e.g., a confidential financial report shared with specific external partners under NDA). In such cases, ensure temporary tags and additional handling restrictions.

### Tagging Integration with Systems

1. Document Management Systems (DMS): Ensure DMS solutions are configured to support tagging labels, restricting access based on assigned tags.
2. Email Systems: Integrate data tags into email filters, with alerts or blocks on sending Confidential or Restricted data externally.
3. Cloud Storage: Configure cloud storage solutions to automatically enforce permissions based on data tagging.
4. Endpoint Protection and DLP: Use endpoint protection software and DLP tools to monitor, alert, or block actions involving sensitive data outside designated channels.

### Tagging Review and Compliance

- Monthly Access Reviews: Conduct monthly access reviews for Confidential and Restricted data tags to ensure compliance with role-based access controls.
- Annual Policy Audit: An annual review of the tagging framework to incorporate any regulatory updates, best practices, or changes in business operations.
- Employee Acknowledgment: Require all employees to acknowledge their understanding of data tags and handling protocols as part of annual compliance training.

### Summary Table of Tagging Levels

| Tagging Level   | Access Control           | Encryption       | Sharing Permissions           | Monitoring                 |

| Internal    | Employees only           | Not required     | Limited to approved parties   | Periodic access audits     |
| Confidential | Role-based authorization | Mandatory        | Internal sharing; external with approval | Full access logs           |
| Restricted  | Strict need-to-know basis | Mandatory with MFA | No external sharing; limited internal sharing | DLP monitoring, full audit |
