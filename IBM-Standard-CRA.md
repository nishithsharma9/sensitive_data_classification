**Client Relationship Agreement ![](Aspose.Words.fda41b19-c35d-4173-9e32-dd31ff0e530e.001.png)**

**International Business Machines Corporation, 1 New Orchard Road, Armonk, New York 10504** 

This Client Relationship Agreement (CRA) and applicable Attachments and Transaction Documents are the complete agreement regarding each transaction under this CRA (together, the "Agreement") under which Client may order Programs, Cloud and other Services, Machines and Appliances (collectively, IBM Products) and third-party products and services (Non-IBM Products). 

Transaction Documents (TDs) provide the specifics of transactions, such as charges and a description of and information about the Product. Examples of TDs include statements of work, service descriptions, license information, licensed program specifications, ordering documents, supplements, or invoices. There may be more than one TD applicable to a transaction. 

Attachments provide supplemental terms that apply across certain types of IBM Products or Non-Products. 

In the event of conflict, an Attachment prevails over this CRA and a TD prevails over both the CRA and any Attachment and only applies to the specific transaction. 

1. **Program License** 
For Programs packaged with IBM's International Program License Agreement (IPLA) or IPLA family license agreements for early release, evaluation or non-warranted Programs, that have specific use rights and terms, those terms apply. For all other IBM Programs, the following license applies. The terms of the IPLA and terms of this CRA related to acquisition and licensing of Programs are equivalent terms. 

  a. A Program is an executable IBM-branded computer program and related material and includes whole and partial copies. Program details are described in TDs and can be found in the Program's system command directory, at [http://www.ibm.com/software/sla ](http://www.ibm.com/software/sla)(for Passport Advantage Programs) or[ http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter ](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter)(for other IBM Programs), or as otherwise specified by IBM. IBM Software Policies (such as backup, temporary use and IBM approved cloud environment) available at[ http://www.ibm.com/softwarepolicies ](http://www.ibm.com/softwarepolicies)apply to Client's use of Programs. Programs do not include Machine Code or Project Materials as defined below. 
  b. Copies of Programs are copyrighted and licensed.  
  c. Client is granted a nonexclusive license to - 
    1) use each copy of a Program, subject to the terms of the Agreement and up to the number of license entitlements Client acquires from IBM or an IBM Business Partner ("Authorized Use");  
    2) make and install copies to support such Authorized Use; and  
    3) make a backup copy as described in IBM's Software Policies.  
  d. Programs may be used by Client, its employees and contractors. Client may not rent or lease a Program or provide commercial IT, hosting, or timesharing services to any third party. Client may not sublicense, assign, or transfer the license for any Program (except to the extent assignment or transfer may not be legally restricted or as is expressly permitted in a TD or as otherwise agreed by IBM in writing). Additional rights may be available for additional fees or under different terms.  
  e. The license granted for a Program is subject to Client -
    1) reproducing copyright notices and other markings on any copy; 
    2) ensuring anyone who uses the Program- i) does so only on Client's behalf within Client's Authorized Use; and ii) complies with the license terms and the Agreement; 
    3) not reverse assembling, reverse compiling, translating, or reverse engineering the Program, except as expressly permitted by law without the possibility of contractual waiver; and 
    4) not using any of the elements of the Program or related licensed material separately from the Program. 
  f. If a TD for a Program ("Principal Program") states that a "Supporting Programs" is included with the Principal Program, Client may use the Supporting Program subject to any license limitations of the Principal Program and only to support the Principal Program.  
  g. This license applies to each copy of the Program that Licensee makes. 
  h. An update, fix, or patch to a Program is subject to the terms governing the Program unless new terms are provided in an updated TD. Client accepts such new terms upon installation of the update, fix, or patch. If a Program is replaced by an update, Client agrees to promptly discontinue use of the replaced Program. 
  i. Selected licensing type and metrics applicable to a Program license are specified in an Attachment or TD. All Programs licensed on a server or capacity-based metric must be licensed to the full capacity of the server on which the Program is installed, unless sub-capacity usage is available from IBM and Client complies with the applicable sub-capacity requirements and terms as set forth in Attachments and TDs. 
  j. For Programs packaged with an IPLA or IBM License Agreement for Non-Warranted Programs, if Client as licensee is dissatisfied with a Program for any reason, Client may terminate the license by returning the Program and proof of entitlement to IBM or the authorized IBM Business Partner within 30 days of the original acquisition date of such Program for a refund of the amount paid. For a downloaded Program, contact the party Licensee acquired the Program from for refund instructions. 

2. **Services – Cloud Services**  
  a. A Cloud Service is an "as a service" IBM offering that IBM makes available via a network, such as software as a service, platform as a service, infrastructure as a service, or other network delivered services.  
  b. Cloud Services are designed to be available 24/7, subject to maintenance. IBM will provide advance notice of scheduled maintenance. Technical support and service level commitments, if any, are specified in an Attachment or TD. 
  c. When IBM accepts Client's order, IBM provides Client the authorizations specified in the TD. IBM provides the facilities, personnel, equipment, software, and other resources necessary to provide Cloud Services. IBM provides generally available user guides and documentation to support Client's use of the IBM Cloud Service. 
  d. Enabling Software is software that Client downloads to Client systems that facilitates the use of a Cloud Service and will be identified in a TD. Enabling Software is not part of the Cloud Service and Client may use Enabling Software only in connection with use of the Cloud Service and in accordance with any licensing terms specified in a TD. The licensing terms will specify applicable warranties, if any. **Otherwise, Enabling Software is provided as-is, without warranties of any kind.** 
  e. Client will provide hardware, software and connectivity to access and use Cloud Services, including any required Client- specific URL addresses and associated certificates. 
  f. Client's authorized users may access Cloud Services only to the extent of authorizations Client acquires. Client is responsible for use of Cloud Services by any user who accesses the Cloud Services with Client's account credentials.  
  g. The following acceptable use terms apply for Client's use of the Cloud Services. Cloud Services may not be used to undertake any activity or host Content that- i) is unlawful, fraudulent, harmful, malicious, obscene, or offensive; ii) threatens or violates the rights of others; iii) disrupts or gains (or intends to disrupt or gain) unauthorized access to data, services, networks, or computing environments within or external to IBM; iv) sends unsolicited, abusive or deceptive messages of any type; or v) distributes any form of malware.  Client may not use Cloud Services for crypto-mining, unless otherwise agreed by IBM in writing. Client may not- i) reverse engineer any portion of a Cloud Service; ii) assign or resell direct access to a Cloud Service to a third party outside Client's Enterprise; or iii) combine a Cloud Service with Client's value add to create a Client-branded solution that Client markets to its end user customers unless otherwise agreed by IBM in writing. 

2.1. **Changes and Withdrawal of IBM Cloud Services** 
  a. At any time and at IBM's discretion, IBM may change Cloud Services, including corresponding published descriptions.  
  b. The intent of any change will be to- i) make available additional features and functionality; ii) improve and clarify existing commitments; or iii) maintain alignment to current adopted operational and security standards or applicable laws. Changes will not degrade the security or functionality of the Cloud Services.  
  c. Changes will be effective when published or on the specified effective date. Any Changes that do not meet the conditions specified above will only take effect, and Client accepts, upon- i) a new order; ii) the term renewal date for the Cloud Services that automatically renew; or iii) notification from IBM of the change effective date for ongoing services that do not have a specified term. 
  d. IBM may withdraw a Cloud Service on 12 months' notice. IBM will continue to provide withdrawn Cloud Services for the remainder of Client's unexpired term or work with Client to migrate to another generally available IBM offering.  
2.2 **Term and Termination of Cloud Services** 
  a. The term begins on the date IBM notifies Client that Client can access the Cloud Services. The ordering TD will specify whether the Cloud Services renew automatically, proceed on a continuous use basis, or terminate at the end of the term. For automatic renewal, unless Client provides written notice to IBM or the IBM Business Partner involved in the Cloud Services not to renew at least 30 days prior to the term expiration date, the Cloud Services will automatically renew for the specified term. For continuous use, the Cloud Services will continue to be available on a month-to-month basis until Client provides 30 days written termination notice to IBM or the IBM Business Partner involved in the Cloud Services. The Cloud Services will remain available until the end of the calendar month after such 30-day period. 
  b. IBM may suspend or limit, to the extent necessary, Client's use of a Cloud Service if IBM reasonably determines there is a material breach of Client's obligations, security breach, violation of law, or breach of the acceptable use terms set forth in section 2 above. IBM will provide notice prior to a suspension, as commercially reasonable. If the cause of a suspension can reasonably be remedied, IBM will provide notice of the actions Client must take to reinstate the Cloud Services. If Client fails to take such actions within a reasonable time, IBM may terminate the Cloud Services. 
  c. Client may terminate a Cloud Service on 30 days' notice- i) at the written recommendation of a government or regulatory agency following a change in either applicable law or the Cloud Services; ii) if a change to the Cloud Services causes Client to be noncompliant with applicable laws; or iii) if IBM notifies Client of a change to the Cloud Services that has a material adverse effect on Client's use of the Cloud Services, provided that IBM will have 90 days to work with Client to minimize such effect. In the event of any such Client termination above or a similar termination of a Non-IBM Product as permitted in the third-party agreement terms, IBM shall refund a portion of any prepaid amounts for the applicable Cloud Service for the period after the date of termination. Client may terminate a Cloud Services for material breach of IBM's obligations by IBM giving notice and reasonable time to comply. If the Cloud Services or Non- IBM Products are terminated for any other reason, Client will pay to IBM, on the date of termination, the total amounts due per the Agreement. Upon termination, IBM may assist Client in transitioning Content to an alternative technology for an additional charge and under separately agreed terms. 

3. **Services – Other Services** 
    a. Services are project or other labor-based Services, such as consulting, installation, customization and configuration, maintenance, Program support, and remote services IBM provides to Client. When IBM accepts Client's order, IBM will provide or make the Services as described in an Attachment or TD.  
    b. Services to support and maintain IBM Products and applicable Non-IBM Products are described in IBM's Support Guide at[ https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/733923 ](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/733923)and applicable terms in an Attachment, TD or as available under separate agreement.  
3.1. **Service Deliverables Ownership and Licensing** 
    a. When IBM provides deliverables, Client will own the copyright in works of authorship that IBM develops for Client as described in a TD (Project Materials). Project Materials exclude Existing Works. Existing Works are works of authorship delivered to Client, but not created, under the SOW, and includes any modifications or enhancements of such works made during the performance of the Services. Some Existing Works may be subject to a separate license agreement (Existing Licensed Works). A Program is an example of an Existing Licensed Work and is subject to its Program terms.  
    b. IBM grants Client an irrevocable (subject to Client's payment obligations), nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, execute, reproduce, display, perform and prepare derivatives of Existing Works that are not Existing Licensed Works. IBM retains an irrevocable, nonexclusive, worldwide, paid-up license to use, execute, reproduce, display, perform, sublicense, distribute, and prepare derivative works of Project Materials. 
3.2. **Services Termination** 
    a. Either party may terminate a Service if a material breach concerning the Service is not remedied within a reasonable time.  
    b. IBM will provide at least 90 days' notice prior to withdrawal of standard Services offerings.  
    c. Client agrees to pay charges for Services provided through the effective date of termination.  
    d. If Client terminates without cause or IBM terminates for breach, Client will-  
        1) meet all minimum commitments; 
        2) pay termination or adjustment charges specified in a TD; and 
        3) pay any additional costs IBM reasonably incurs because of early termination, such as costs relating to subcontracts or resource relocation. 
        IBM will take reasonable steps to mitigate any such additional costs. 
    e. Specific termination rights for a Service may be specified in a TD. 

4. **Machines and Appliances** 
    a. A Machine is an IBM-branded device including its features, upgrades, and accessories. An Appliance is a Program and an IBM or a Non-IBM Machine combination designed for a particular function. Unless otherwise provided, terms that apply to a Program apply to the Program component of an Appliance and terms that apply to a Machine apply to the Machine component of an Appliance. Client may not use or transfer an Appliance's Program component independently of the Appliance. 
    b. When IBM accepts Client's order, IBM transfers title to Machines and Non-IBM machines to Client or Client's lessor upon payment of all amounts due, except in the United States where title transfers upon shipment. IBM bears risk of loss until delivery to the carrier for shipment. IBM pays for insurance on Client's behalf until delivery to Client's location. Client must report any loss in writing to IBM within 10 business days of delivery and follow the claim procedure. Additional charges may apply for IBM installation more than six months after shipment. Client must follow instructions provided to install Client set up Machines. 
    c. Machines and parts removed or exchanged for upgrade, warranty service, or maintenance are IBM property and must be returned to IBM promptly. A replacement assumes the warranty or maintenance status of the replaced part. A Machine may include parts that are not new, and, in some instances, Machines may have been previously installed. Regardless, IBM's warranty terms apply. Client will promptly install or allow IBM to install mandatory engineering changes. Client may only acquire Machines for use within Client's Enterprise in the country where acquired and not for resale, lease, or transfer. Lease-back financing is permitted. 
4.1  Machine Code and Built in Capacity** 
    a. Machines may include Machine Code (MC) and Built in Capacity (BIC). MC is computer instructions, fixes, replacements, and related materials, such as data and passwords relied on, provided, used with or generated by MC, that permit the operation of the machine's processors, storage or other functionality. “MC may include Other Internal Licensed Code (OILC) licensed under a separate agreement as identified for a Machine in the server product support pages at[ https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/631391.](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/631391) BIC is computing resource (e.g., processors, storage and other functionality) that IBM provides for a Machine. Use of BIC may be restricted by contract, technology or other measures. 
    b. Copies of MC are copyrighted and licensed. IBM only provides copies, fixes or replacements for MC for Machines under warranty or IBM maintenance, or under a separate written agreement which may be subject to additional charges. Client agrees that all copies, fixes or replacements for MC will be obtained solely as authorized by IBM. 
    c. Client is granted a nonexclusive license to use MC only- i) on the Machine for which IBM provided it; and ii) to access and use BIC only to the extent paid for by Client, activated by IBM and subject to the IBM Authorized Use Table for Machines (AUT) Attachment available at [http://www.ibm.com/systems/support/machine_warranties/machine_code/aut.html.](http://www.ibm.com/systems/support/machine_warranties/machine_code/aut.html)  
    d. Except as provided in an OILC, Client may not alter, reverse assemble, reverse compile, translate or reverse engineer the MC, or circumvent or interfere, by any means, with IBM's contractual, technological or other measures that restrict, monitor or report on use of BIC or MC.  
    e. Client agrees to IBM's implementation of technological and other measures that restrict, monitor and report on use of BIC or MC, and to install any changes IBM provides. Use of BIC in excess of authorizations from IBM is subject to additional charges. 
    f. While Client's license to MC is in effect, Client may transfer possession of the entire MC along with all of Client's rights and obligations only with corresponding transfer of the Machine, including BIC, and a hardcopy of this MC license, and only if the transferee agrees to the terms of this MC license. Client's MC license terminates immediately upon transfer. 
    g. This Agreement governs MC and BIC on Machines Client acquires from another party.
5. **Content and Data Protection** 
    a. Content consists of all data, software, and information that Client or its authorized users provides, authorizes access to, or inputs to the Cloud Service or information or data Client may provide, make available or grant access to, in connection with IBM providing other Services. Client grants the rights and permissions to IBM, its affiliates, and contractors of either, to use, provide, store, and otherwise process Content solely for the purpose of providing the Cloud Services or other Services. Use of the Cloud Services or other Services will not affect Client's ownership or license rights in Content.  
    b. IBM, its affiliates, and contractors of either may access and use the Content solely for the purpose of providing and managing the applicable Cloud Services or other Services. IBM will treat all Content as confidential by only disclosing to IBM employees and contractors to the extent necessary to provide the Cloud Services or perform other Services.  
    c. Client is responsible for obtaining all necessary rights and permissions to permit processing of Content in the Cloud Services or to provide other Services. Client will make disclosures and obtain consent required by law before Client provides, authorizes access to or inputs individuals' information, including personal or other regulated data, for processing in the Cloud Services or use by IBM in providing the other Services.  
    d. If any Content could be subject to governmental regulation or may require security measures beyond those specified by IBM for the Cloud Services or to provide other Services, Client will not provide, allow access to, or input the Content for processing in the Cloud Services or provide or allow access of Content to IBM to provide other Services unless specifically permitted in the applicable TD or unless IBM has first agreed in writing to implement additional security and other measures. Client is responsible for adequate back-up of Content on Client managed systems prior to providing or allowing access of Content to IBM to provide Services. 
    e. IBM Data Security and Privacy Principles (DSP), at[ http://ibm.com/terms/?id=z126-7745,](http://ibm.com/terms/?id=z126-7745) apply for generally available standard Cloud Services and other Services as identified in a TD. At IBM's discretion, IBM may change the DSP from time to time and the change will be effective when published or on the specified effective date. The intent of any change will be to improve and clarify existing commitments and maintain alignment to current adopted operational and security standards or applicable laws. The intent is not to degrade the security or functionality. 
    f. The specific security features and functions of a Cloud Service or other Services will be described in the applicable Attachment and TD. Client is responsible for selecting, ordering, enabling, or using available data protection features appropriate to support Client's use of Cloud Services. Client is responsible for assessing the suitability of the Cloud Services for the Content and Client's intended use or the use of Content with the Services IBM will provide. Client acknowledges that the use of Cloud Services and other Services meet Client's requirements and processing instructions required to comply with applicable laws. 
    g. IBM's Data Processing Addendum (DPA) is found at[ http://ibm.com/dpa.](http://ibm.com/dpa) The DPA and applicable DPA Exhibit(s) apply to IBM’s processing of personal data on behalf of the Client. 
    h. For Cloud Services with self-managed features, Client can remove Content at any time. Otherwise, IBM will return or remove Content from IBM computing resources upon the expiration or cancellation of the Cloud Service, other Services, or earlier upon Client's request. IBM may charge for certain activities performed at Client's request (such as delivering Content in a specific format). IBM does not archive Content; however, some Content may remain in backup files until expiration of such files as governed by IBM's backup retention practices.
6. **Warranties**  
    a. IBM warrants that a Program, when used in its specified operating environment conforms to its specifications. The warranty period for a Program (not the Program component of an Appliance) is 12 months from acquisition, or the initial license term if less than 12 months, unless another warranty period is specified in an Attachment or TD.  
    b. During the Program warranty period, Client will have access to IBM databases containing information on known Program defects, defect corrections, restrictions, and bypasses as described in the IBM Support Guide at [http://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/733923.](http://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/733923)
    c. IBM warrants that it provides Cloud Services and Services using commercially reasonable care and skill and as described in an applicable Attachment or TD, including any completion criteria. Project Materials will comply with the Attachment or TD at the time of delivery. The warranty for Cloud Services or Services ends when the Cloud Services or Services end.
    d. IBM warrants that a Machine when used in its specified operating environment conform to its specifications. For a Machine or Appliance, the warranty period is specified in the Attachment or TD. During its warranty period, IBM will repair or exchange the Machine without charge, as specified in the Attachment or TD. Warranty does not apply to Machines that Client did not allow IBM to install as required by the TD. Client may purchase warranty service upgrades and post warranty support where available. For Appliances, post warranty support includes maintenance and S&S.
    e. If a Machine, Appliance, or Program does not function as warranted during its warranty period and IBM is unable to repair or replace it with a functional equivalent, Client may return it to IBM or the IBM Business Partner and upon such return receive a refund of the amount Client paid (for recurring charges, up to twelve months' charges) and Client's license or right to use terminates.
    f. These warranties are the exclusive warranties from IBM and replace all other warranties, including the implied warranties or conditions of satisfactory quality, merchantability, non-infringement, and fitness for a particular purpose. IBM does not warrant uninterrupted or error-free operation of an IBM Product or that IBM will correct all defects or prevent third-party disruptions or unauthorized third-party access to an IBM Product. IBM warranties will not apply if there has been misuse, modification, damage not caused by IBM, or failure to comply with written instructions provided by IBM. Non-IBM Products and preview products, or identified non- warranted IBM Products, are sold under the Agreement as-is, without warranties of any kind. Third parties may provide their own warranties to Client for Non-IBM Products. 
    g. Additional support available during or after the warranty period may be available under separate agreement.
7. **Charges, Taxes, Payment and Verification**
    a. Client's right to use an IBM Program or Non-IBM Program or IBM Cloud Services or Non-IBM Cloud Services is contingent on Client paying applicable charges as specified in a TD or applicable agreement under which Client acquired the entitlements. Client is responsible to acquire additional entitlements in advance of any increase of its use.
    b. Client agrees to pay all applicable charges specified in a TD for an IBM Product or Non-IBM Product and charges for use in excess of authorizations. Charges are exclusive of any customs or other duty, tax, and similar levies imposed by any authority resulting from Client's acquisitions under the Agreement and will be invoiced in addition to such charges. Amounts are due upon receipt of the invoice from IBM and payable within 30 days of the invoice date to an account specified by IBM and late payment fees may apply. Prepaid IBM Products or Non-IBM Products must be used within the applicable period. IBM does not give credits or refunds for any prepaid, one-time charges, or other charges already due or paid, except as may be specified in an Agreement. The parties agree no tangible personal property (e.g. media or publications) shall transfer to Client if: i) IBM delivers Programs electronically to Client, or ii) Client claims a sales or use tax exemption for Programs IBM delivers electronically to Client. Where taxes are based upon the location(s) receiving the benefit of the Cloud Service, Client has an ongoing obligation to notify IBM of such location(s) if different than Client's business address listed in the applicable Attachment or TD.
    c. In the event Client is required to pay any withholding or deduction of tax required under an applicable governmental entity regulation based on IBM’s charge for a cross border transaction, Client will increase the sum payable by the amount necessary to ensure IBM receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no withholdings or deductions been made. Client is responsible to pay any withholding tax directly to the appropriate government entity where required by law.
    d. If Client imports, exports, transfers, accesses, or uses an IBM Product or Non-IBM Product across a border, Client agrees to be responsible for and pay authorities any custom, duty, tax, or similar levy assessed by the authorities. This excludes those taxes based on IBM's net income.
    e. IBM will invoice: i) recurring charges at the beginning of the selected billing frequency term; ii) overage and usage charges in arrears; and iii) one-time charges upon IBM's acceptance of an order.
    f. IBM may change recurring charges, labor rates and minimum commitments on 90 days' notice, except for Cloud Services. For Cloud Services, if IBM commits to pricing as specified in a TD, IBM will not change such pricing during the specified term. If there is not a specified commitment, then IBM may change pricing on thirty days' notice. A change applies on the invoice date or the first day of the charging period or new term on or after the effective date IBM specifies in the notice. IBM may change one-time charges without notice. However, a change to a one-time charge does not apply to an order if: i) IBM receives the order before the announcement date of the increase; and ii) within 90 days after IBM's receipt of the order, the Product is shipped or made available to Client.
7.1  **Licensing Verification**
    a. Client will, for all Programs and MC, at all sites and for all environments, create, retain, and each year provide to IBM upon request within 30 days' advance notice: i) a report, in a format requested by IBM using records, system tools output, and other system information; and ii) supporting documentation (collectively, "Deployment Data").
    b. Upon reasonable notice, IBM and its independent auditors may verify Client's compliance with this Agreement, at all sites and for all environments, in which Client uses (for any purposes) Programs and MC.Verification will be conducted in a manner that minimizes disruption to Client's business and may be conducted on Client's premises, during normal business hours. IBM will have a written confidentiality agreement with the independent auditor. In addition to providing Deployment Data described above, Licensee agrees to provide to IBM and its auditors additional accurate information and Deployment Data upon request.
    c. Client will promptly order and pay charges at IBM's then current rates associated with: i) any deployments in excess of authorizations indicated on or by any annual report or verification; ii) applicable software maintenance or subscription and support services (S&S) for such excess deployments for the lesser of the duration of such excess use or two years; and iii) any additional charges and other liabilities determined as a result of such verification, including but not limited to taxes, duties, and regulatory fees.
8. **Liability and Intellectual Property Protection**
    a. IBM's entire liability for all claims related to the Agreement will not exceed the amount of any actual direct damages incurred by Client up to the amounts paid (if recurring charges, up to 12 months' charges apply) for the Product that is the subject of the claim, regardless of the basis of the claim. IBM will not be liable for special, incidental, exemplary, indirect, or economic consequential damages, or lost profits, business, value, revenue, goodwill, or anticipated savings. These limitations apply collectively to IBM, its affiliates, contractors, and suppliers.
    b. The following amounts are not subject to the above cap: i) third-party payments related to infringement claims described in the paragraph c below; and ii) damages that cannot be limited under applicable law. 
    c. If a third party asserts a claim against Client that an IBM Product acquired under the Agreement infringes a patent or copyright, IBM will defend Client against that claim and pay amounts finally awarded by a court against Client or included in a settlement approved by IBM. To obtain IBM's defense against and payment of infringement claims, Client must promptly: i) notify IBM in writing of the claim; ii) supply information requested by IBM; and iii) allow IBM to control, and reasonably cooperate in, the defense and settlement, including mitigation efforts. IBM's defense and payment obligations for infringement claims extend to claims of infringement based on open-source code that IBM selects and embeds in an IBM Product.
    d. IBM has no responsibility for claims based on: i) Non-IBM Products; ii) items not provided by IBM; iii) IBM’s proper use of any Client required third-party product or service related to the administration of the transaction; iv) any violation of law or third-party rights caused by Content, or any Client materials, designs, specifications: or v) Client’s use of a non- current version or release of an IBM Product when an infringement claim could have been avoided by using a current version or release.
9. **Termination**
    a. Either party may terminate: i) this CRA without cause on at least 30 days’ notice to the other after expiration or termination of its obligations under each Agreement; or ii) immediately for cause if the other is in material breach of an Agreement, provided the non-complying party is given notice and reasonable time to comply. Termination of this CRA does not terminate transactions in effect and not affected by the cause of a material breach and provisions of the Agreement, as they relate to such transactions, remain in effect until fulfilled or otherwise terminated in accordance with the Agreement term. Upon any termination of Client’s license to use a Program or MC, Client will promptly destroy all copies of the Program or MC after either party has terminated the license.
    b. Any terms that by their nature extend beyond the Agreement termination remain in effect until fulfilled and apply to successors and assignees.
    c. Each party will allow the other reasonable opportunity to comply before it claims the other has not met its obligations. Client’s failure to pay, or Client providing inaccurate or fraudulent account or payment information to acquire IBM Products or Non-IBM Products, is a material breach.
10. **Governing Laws and Geographic Scope**
    a. Both parties agree to the application of the laws of the State of New York, United States, without regard to conflict of law principles. Any disputes will be brought before a court of competent jurisdiction within the United States.
    b. The rights and obligations of each party are valid only in the country where the transaction is performed (or for IBM or Non-IBM Cloud Services or remotely delivered IBM or Non-IBM Services, the country of Client’s business address) or, if IBM agrees, the country where the IBM Product or Non-IBM Product is placed in productive use, except all licenses are valid as specifically granted.
    c. Each party is also responsible for complying with: i) laws and regulations applicable to its business and Content; and ii) import, export and economic sanction laws and regulations, including the defense trade control regime of the United States of America and any applicable jurisdiction, that prohibit or restrict the import, export, re-export, or transfer of products, technology, services or data, directly or indirectly, to or for certain countries, end uses or end users. IBM will not serve as Client’s exporter or importer, except as required by data protection laws, for: i) any Content; or ii) use of any portion of a Cloud Service from a country outside Client’s business address.
    d. If any provision of the Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in full force and effect. Nothing in the Agreement affects statutory rights of consumers that cannot be waived or limited by contract. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to transactions under the Agreement.
11. **General**
    a. IBM is an independent contractor, not Client’s agent, joint venturer, partner, or fiduciary, and does not undertake to perform any of Client’s regulatory obligations or assume any responsibility for Client’s business or operations. Client is responsible for its use of IBM Products and Non-IBM Products. IBM is acting as an information technology provider only. IBM’s direction, suggested usage, guidance, or Client’s use of an IBM Product does not constitute medical, clinical, legal, accounting, or other licensed professional advice. Client should obtain its own expert advice. Each party is responsible for determining the assignment of its and its affiliates personnel and their respective contractors, and for their direction, control, and compensation.
    b. For Programs IBM provides to Client in tangible form, IBM fulfills its shipping and delivery obligations upon the delivery of such Programs to the IBM-designated carrier, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Client and IBM.
    c. Client may not use IBM Products or Non-IBM Products if failure or interruption of the IBM Products or Non-IBM Products could lead to death, serious bodily injury, or property or environmental damage. 
    d. Parties will not disclose confidential information to employees or contractors of the other party without a separate, signed confidentiality agreement. If confidential information is exchanged in connection with the Agreement, the applicable confidentiality agreement is incorporated into, and subject to, this CRA. This paragraph does not apply to Content provided in the use of an IBM Cloud Service or Non-IBM Cloud Service. 
    e. Client accepts an Attachment or TD by ordering, enrolling, using, or making a payment for, the IBM Product or Non-IBM Product. Since this CRA may apply to many future orders, IBM may change this CRA by providing Client at least 90 days’ written notice. Changes are not retroactive. They will only apply as of the effective date to: i) new orders; ii) ongoing or continuous IBM Product or Non-IBM Product offerings that do not expire; and iii) renewals. For transactions with a defined renewable contract period stated in a TD, Client may request that IBM defer the change effective date until the end of the current contract period. Client accepts changes by placing new orders or continuing use after the change effective date or allowing transactions to renew after receipt of the change notice. Except as specifically provided in this CRA or as specified in an Attachment or TD, all changes to an Agreement must be in writing accepted by both parties.
    f. IBM maintains a robust set of business conduct and related guidelines covering conflicts of interest, market abuse, anti- bribery and corruption, and fraud. IBM and its personnel comply with such policies and require contractors to have similar policies.
    g. IBM, its affiliates, and contractors of either require use of business contact information and certain account usage information. This information is not Content. Business contact information is used to communicate and manage business dealings with the Client. Examples of business contact information include name, business telephone, address, email, user ID, and tax registration information. Account usage information is required to enable, provide, manage, support, administer, and improve IBM Products. Examples of account usage information include reported errors and digital information gathered using tracking technologies, such as cookies and web beacons, during use of IBM Products. The IBM Privacy Statement at[ https://www.ibm.com/privacy/ ](https://www.ibm.com/privacy/)provides additional details with respect to IBM’s collection, use, and handling of business contact and account usage information. When Client provides information to IBM and notice to, or consent by, the individuals is required for such processing, Client will notify individuals and obtain consent. 
    h. IBM Business Partners who use or make available IBM Products or Non-IBM Products are independent from IBM and unilaterally determine their prices and terms. IBM is not responsible for their actions, omissions, statements, or offerings. If IBM notifies Client their current IBM Business Partner will no longer resell an IBM Product, Client may select to acquire auto renewing or continuous use of IBM Products directly from IBM or from another authorized IBM Business Partner.
    i. IBM may offer Non-IBM Products, or an IBM Product may enable access to Non-IBM Product, that may require acceptance of third-party terms presented to the Client. Linking to or use of Non-IBM Products constitutes Client’s agreement with such terms. Third-party terms and privacy practices govern use of a Non-IBM Cloud Service or other Service, including Content Client may provide, grant access to or input to. IBM will invoice Client for charges due and submit Client’s order details to the third-party provider for the enablement and delivery of the Non-IBM Product. IBM is not a party to any third-party agreement and is not responsible for Non-IBM Products. Access to ongoing Non-IBM Products may be discontinued at any time if the third party discontinues or IBM no longer makes available such Non- IBM Products.
    j. An IBM Product or Non-IBM Product or feature of an IBM Product or Non-IBM Product is considered “preview product” when IBM makes such product or features available at no charge, with limited or pre-release functionality, or for a limited time, to try available functionality (such as beta, trial, evaluation, no-charge, or designated preview products).Service level agreements, if any, do not apply to preview products. A preview product may not be covered by support and IBM may change or discontinue a preview product at any time and without notice. For any preview product that is provided as pre-release, IBM is not obligated to release a generally available product. Client is responsible to return a preview product or place an order under generally available terms for acquiring IBM Product or Non-IBM Product beyond the preview period. IBM may provide Client opportunities to voluntarily provide feedback in connection with the use of IBM Products, which IBM may use for any purpose.
    k. Neither party may assign the Agreement, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of the other. IBM may assign rights to receive payments. IBM will remain responsible to perform its obligations. Assignment by IBM in conjunction with the sale of the portion of IBM’s business that includes an IBM Product or Non-IBM Product is not restricted. IBM may share an Agreement and related documents in conjunction with any assignment.
    l. This CRA applies to IBM and Client (accepting this CRA) and their respective Enterprise companies that provide or acquire IBM Products or Non-IBM Products under this CRA. The parties shall each coordinate the activities of their own Enterprise companies under this CRA. Enterprise companies include: i) companies within the same country that Client or IBM control (by owning greater than 50% of the voting shares); and ii) any other entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with Client or IBM and has agreed to a participation agreement.
    m. All notices under the Agreement must be in writing and sent to the business address specified for the Agreement unless a party designates in writing a different address. The parties consent to the use of electronic means and facsimile transmissions for communications as a signed writing. Any reproduction of the Agreement made by reliable means is considered an original. The Agreement supersedes any course of dealing, discussions or representations between the parties. Where approval, acceptance, consent, access, cooperation, or similar action by either party is required, such action will not be unreasonably delayed or withheld. 
    n. No right or cause of action for any third party is created by the Agreement or any transaction under it. Neither party will bring a legal action arising out of or related to the Agreement more than two years after the cause of action arose. Neither party is responsible for failure to fulfill its non-monetary obligations due to causes beyond its control.
    o. IBM may use personnel and resources in locations worldwide, including third-party contractors to support the delivery of IBM Products and Non-IBM Products. Client’s use of IBM Products or Non-IBM Products may result in the transfer of Content, including personally identifiable information, across country borders. A list of countries where Content may be transferred and processed is described in the applicable TD or support documentation. IBM is responsible for the obligations under the Agreement even if IBM uses a third-party contractor and will have appropriate agreements in place to enable IBM to meet its obligations. 
    p. If IBM and Client agree to use a Client requested third-party service to support the procurement or payment activities associated with an Agreement, IBM agrees to submit or receive applicable documents (such as invoices or similar contracting documents) using the third-party service.  In the event: i) the third-party service becomes unavailable for any reason; or ii) the third-party provider modifies the service or terms of use in a manner IBM deems commercially unacceptable, the Client agrees to directly accept documents. Client remains responsible to IBM for timely payments of invoices and for any claims or proceedings related to the third-party service provider’s failure to comply with applicable laws or for such provider’s use, misuse, or disclosure of data or confidential information. IBM agrees to promptly notify Client in writing of any such claim or proceeding.
